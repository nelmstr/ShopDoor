I need a program for an esp32
It will operate three relays, have three buttons, and have two magnetic reed sensors. It will show button operation and door position from sensor state.
Open button operation:
- This button is a capacitive touch sensor connected to pin 4 and a button on a web page
- Opens a garage door with a relay that is connected to pin 32. This relay will only close for 250 ms.
- Operates when sensor 2 is open.
Close button operation:
- This button is a capacitive button connected to pin 2 and a button on a web page
- Closes the garage door with a relay that is connected to pin 33. This relay will close for 30 seconds.
- Operates when sensor 1 is open
Button 3 operation:
- This button is a capacitive button connected to pin 15 and a button on a web page
- Stops garage door operation with a relay that is connected to pin 25 and opening the relay on pin 33
When the program starts it attempts to determine if the door is closed by sensing if sensor 1 is open.
When sensor 1 is closed the web page will show the door as closed
when sensor 2 is closed the web page will show the door as open.
IMPORTANT:  The stop buttons on the web page and touch sensors MUST stop the door by opening the open and close relays immediately
